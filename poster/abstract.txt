Rendezvous with Rama: Ramageddon!

Jordan Boyd, Ashley Mascareno, Andy Winhold

    Near earth objects (NEOs) and the devastation they have caused Earth in the past continues to pose risks in the future. Should an extrasolar object following a hyperbolic trajectory graze too close to Earth, determining whether the Earth is on a potential collision course is vital.
    Inspired by Arthur C. Clarke’s “Rendezvous With Rama”, this Python-based simulation reenact the hyperbolic orbit of extrasolar object Rama, a 50km long, cylindrical alien starship on a trajectory through the inner solar system passes. The simulation scenario imagines what kind of threat Rama may pose if it was a bit closer to Earth. 
    Using Newtonian and Keplerian orbital mechanics coupled with the velocity verlet algorithm, the simulation computes the positions and velocities to make predictions about the orbits of Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, and Rama from a heliocentric frame of reference.    
    The prediction for the velocity Rama needed to maintain a hyperbolic orbit was found to be 41.7 km/s, and the smallest distance between Earth and Rama for the duration of the trajectory was found to be 39,127 km. The eccentric anomalies for the inner planets were found to converge at tolerance 1e-5. The code is available at https://github.com/ASU-CompMethodsPhysics-PHY494/final-rendezvous-with-ramageddon.
